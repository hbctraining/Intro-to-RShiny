# Exercise 1

Which hosting platform do you think will best work for an app that you'd make in the future?

This is a subjective question and depends on your use case. Using [Posit Connect](https://posit.co/products/enterprise/connect/) gives you some flexibility as to who can access your app, while Shinylive apps can be hosted directly on GitHub. [Shinyapps.io](https://www.shinyapps.io/) isn't usually a great option due to the limited compute time on the free level.
