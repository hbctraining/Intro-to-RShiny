title: "Layout Practical"
description: |
  Learn how to enhance the visual structure and usability of your Shiny applications by organizing the user interface with sidebarPanel(), mainPanel(), and tabsetPanel(). In this hands-on practical, you will redesign an existing interactive data visualization app (using mtcars) to separate controls, plots, and tables into logical, easy-to-navigate sections. This activity will help you develop key design skills for building more effective R Shiny dashboards.

# Layout Practical

Let's enhance the layout of the app that we created in the practical exercise last session:

```{r}
#| label: first_practical_full_answer
#| eval: false
library(shiny)
library(DT)
library(tidyverse)

# User Interface
ui <- fluidPage(
  # Dropdown menu to select which column will be used for the x-axis
  selectInput(inputId = "x_axis_input",
              label = "Select x-axis",
              choices = colnames(mtcars),
              selected = "mpg"), 
   # Dropdown menu to select which column will be used for the y-axis
  selectInput(inputId = "y_axis_input",
              label = "Select y-axis",
              choices = colnames(mtcars),
              selected = "disp"),
  # The output plot
  plotOutput(outputId = "plot",
             brush = "plot_brush"),
  # The output table
  DTOutput("table")
)

# Server
server <- function(input, output) {
  # Render the scatter plot
  output$plot <- renderPlot({
    # Scatter plot creation
    ggplot(mtcars) +
      geom_point(aes_string(x = input$x_axis_input,
                            y = input$y_axis_input))
  })
  # Render a table from points within the rectangle created by clicking and dragging over the plot
  output$table <- renderDT({
    brushedPoints(mtcars, input$plot_brush)
  })
}

# Run the app
shinyApp(ui = ui, server = server)
```

Let's place the `selectInput()` in a `sidebarPanel()` and then in the `mainPanel()`, let's use a tabset where the plot is in one tab and the brushed table is in another tab. The app should look like this:
