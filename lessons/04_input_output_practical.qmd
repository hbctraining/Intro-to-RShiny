# Input and Output Practical

In this practical we are going to create the app below:

<p align="center"><iframe src="https://hcbc.connect.hms.harvard.edu/input_output_practical_demo/" width="800" height="600px" data-external="1"></iframe></p>


This app let's us select the columns that we would like to plot and then allows us to use a brush on our plot select an area of points that we are interested in evaluating.

# [**Exercise 1**](04_input_output_practical-Answer_key.qmd#exercise-1)

Let's focus on creating this app in several parts:

1.  Create two `selectInput()` menus to choose the x- and y-axis to plot along with the resulting output plot.

2. Add to our app the ability to brush over the plot and select points to place in a table beneath the plot.
